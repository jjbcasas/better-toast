  Going into this my goal was to target the health-conscious individuals by choosing themes and colors that matches the word healthy. When I was doing the site, I put plenty of options
  for the consumers to have variety and won't feel bored quickly. But at the same time, I don't want them to be overwhelm of the options and be confused.
  So, I made it as simple and straight forward as I can possible make it. I designed the menu that way for it to catch the consumers eye and I used a little Javascript to navigate the
  different options so the consumers won't feel going all over the website.

# Optimizations
  I'll add online orders with a pickup and delivery options for improve user experience and potential increase of sales.

# Lesson Learned
   What I learned while working on this was a suitable media/photos for your website is really worth it and also will make you more efficient in making the site. This also helped me improved
   write good, dry and readable code.
